# hello-world
This is my first repository, I named it hello-world as you can see. Enjoy!


Names Andrew McIntosh, people call me Andrew.

I've been festering on this planet for about 7,300 days now.
New to coding, decided to start with Java, not sure why.
I fish, never catch anything half the time but that's why they call it fishing.
Drinking Java while coding in Java is... It just feels right ok.
I spend too long making things look nice rather than actually coding.

I have two birds, DinkNose and ShitStain. DinkNose is a lovebird native to the forests and savannas of Sub-Saharan Africa.
ShitStain is a parakeet, native to Australia.

That's it, that's all there is to know about me. All my other charactiartics I'll probabily grow out of, don't want to fluff this page up too much.
